= Go Blog

A proof-of-concept blog written in Go, that new language out of Google.  It has no backing store, so if you kill the server, your entries and comments are gone forever.

== Compiling

Presuming you're using the i386 architecture

  $ 8g      models.go
  $ 8g -I . views.go
  $ 8g -I . goblog.go
  $ 8l -o goblog *.8

== Running

  $ ./goblog

This runs the blog on <http://localhost:12345/blog>.  Just Ctrl-C if you want to stop it.
